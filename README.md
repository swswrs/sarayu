<h2>ExamPortal</h2>

A light weight resumable ExamPortal.

This project is a Online Exam Portal based on PHP, MySQLI, JavaScript ,Bootstrap ,HTML and CSS.
This will act as an ideal platform for conducting online tests in rural areas where there is scarcity of electricity.
Even if the PC shuts down suddenly because of power outage, progress of the test will be saved and examination can be
resumed once system reboots.


<b>Instructions:</b>

Clone the repo.<br>
Place it in www folder of your local server.<br>
Import the exam.sql file (it's there in database folder) to PHPMyAdmin.<br>
Open this project in a web browser.<br>
Use email as 'admin@gmail.com' and password as 'qwerty' to log in into the exam portal.<br>
To access admin panel, click on the result button on index page and use same email but password as 'qwerty1'.

<b>Note:</b> Storing password like this is a really bad idea. It's better to hash the password and store it in database.

To start the examination, sign up on the student registration page you will get after logging in. Your exam will start and
at the end of the examination you will get the result.

I hope that that it'll help people from rural background a lot.

<b>Further Scope:</b> Try changing the duration of exam and no. of questions as well. Try making the GUI more sophisticated.
